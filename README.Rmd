Individual-based models of sexual selection, adding in a Weber preference function to determine how coevolution of preferences and ornaments change.

To run:
- Git clone repository
- Navigate to either the Fisher or good genes model directories (/multidimensional_fisher or /multidimensional_goodgenes)
- 'make' to compile the code
- For Fisher models, './make_that_batch_file.r' to generate starting parameters
- For good genes models, './vary_parameters.r > batch_file.sh' to generate starting parameters
- '~/jobeater batch_file.sh [number of cores]' to run the models

All models currently set to run as multidimensional - to run a unidimensional model, simply set ntrait=1
